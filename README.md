## Installation
Go to releases and download the latest release. Unzip the file and open OrbiterAddonsManager.exe.

The available builds are for Windows only.

## Build
You need to have Qt 5.11 and libarchive installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/abdullah-radwan/OAD.git ~/OAD
cd ~/OAD
qmake OAD.pro
make
make clean
chmod u+x OAD
./OAD
```

To build on Windows, open the project with Qt Creator and open src.pro file.
 You need to edit libarchive path `LIBS += -larchive`
 to the folder where you installed it. In my case, it's in D:/Qt/libarchive-3.3.3/libarchive:

```
INCLUDEPATH += D:/Qt/libarchive-3.3.3/libarchive
LIBS += -LD:/Qt/libarchive-3.3.3/libarchive -larchive
```
## About
The program is based on C++, Qt 5.11 and QArchive. Any suggestions, bugs and contributes are welcomed.
